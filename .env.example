# Host Proxy Configuration
# Copy this file to .env and adjust as needed

# Path to the YAML configuration file
CONFIG_PATH=./config.yaml

# Logging level override (trace, debug, info, warn, error)
# LOG_LEVEL=info

# Rust-specific logging (alternative to LOG_LEVEL)
# RUST_LOG=host_proxy=debug,pingora=info

# NOTE: Upstream proxy settings are configured in config.yaml ONLY.
# We intentionally do NOT read HTTP_PROXY/HTTPS_PROXY environment variables
# because you'll typically set those to point to THIS proxy.
# Configure your upstream/corporate proxy in the config.yaml file.
